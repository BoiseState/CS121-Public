# Project 1: Marshmallow Animation

* Author: Grace Hopper
* Class: CS121 Section 2
* Semester: Fall 2018 

## Overview

This Java application displays an animated marshmallow with features based on
user input specifying sponginess, color, sugar density, and burn resistance.

## Reflection

There were parts of this that were really challenging, particularly reading 
the input from the users. Once I figured that out, I really enjoyed showing
the marshmallow!

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac Marshmallow.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java Marshmallow
```

You will be prompted for integer values representing distance to the fire,
fire intensity, marshmallow burn resistance, and marshmallow sugar density.
