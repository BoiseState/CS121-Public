# Project 1: Marshmallow Animation

* Author: Grace Hopper
* Class: CS121 Section 2
* Semester: Fall 2018 

## Overview

This Java application displays an animated marshmallow with features based on
user input specifying sponginess, color, sugar density, and burn resistance.

## Reflection

There were parts of this that were really challenging, particularly reading 
the input from the users. Once I figured that out, I really enjoyed showing
the marshmallow!

Write a two paragraph reflection describing your experience with this 
project.  Talk about what worked well and what was challenging.  
Did you run into an issue that took some time to figure out?  
Tell us about it. What did you enjoy, what was less desirable? Feel
free to add other items (within the two paragraph limit).

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac Marshmallow.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java Marshmallow
```

You will be prompted for integer values representing distance to the fire,
fire intensity, marshmallow burn resistance, and marshmallow sugar density.
