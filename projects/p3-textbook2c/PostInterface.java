/**
 * DO NOT MODIFY THIS INTERFACE - It is the responsibility of your Post class to
 * provide methods that look and behave exactly as defined in this interface.
 * 
 * A Post represents a single text post in a TextBook social media site along with
 * its associated comments. A Post must implement this interface as follows:
 * 	public class Post implements PostInterface
 * 
 * In addition to the methods listed for this interface, a Post is expected to
 * have two constructors, one used to create a new Post and the other to recover 
 * the post and any comments from an associated text file.
 * The new Post constructor must have the following signature:
 * 	public Post(int id, String author, String text)
 * The recovery constructor must have the following signature:
 * 	public Post(int id)
 * 
 * @author mvail, jerryfails

	/**
	 * Adds a comment with the given values and the current timestamp to this Post.
	 * Also appends comment timestamp, author, and text to the Post's associated file.

	 *   00012 2010-08-30T13:38:23.085Z Sam Pondering the meaning of static.
	 *   2010-08-30T15:21:43.055Z Pat Donâ€™t get too existential.

	 * Returns a well-formatted String including the original post and all comments,

	 * timestamp conforms to ISO-8601 standard as returned by an Instant's toString().
	 * Note: "Comments:" header should always be displayed, even if there are no 
	 * comments on the post.
	 * Example:
	 * 	 Post:
	 *   00010 2021-11-30T23:38:23.085Z Mason Did stuff.
