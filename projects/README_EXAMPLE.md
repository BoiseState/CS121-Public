# Project 1: Marshmallow Animation

* Author: Grace Hopper
* Class: CS121 Section 2
* Semester: Fall 2022 

## Overview

This Java application displays an animated marshmallow with features based on
user input specifying sponginess, color, sugar density, and burn resistance.

## Reflection

There were parts of this that were really challenging, particularly figuring 
out which variables to use and how to do write the code to do the math I 
wanted it to do. Once I figured that out, I really enjoyed adding some cool
visuals, like the flying marshmallow!

- What worked well and what was a struggle? 
  - Problem solving the math was a challenge.
- What concepts still aren't quite clear?
  - I still need to better understand the order of operations.
- What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?
  - I put a lot of comments in my code and used print statements to show values of computations.
- What would you change about your design process?
  - Draw it on a piece of paper and figure out the ratios before starting to code.
- If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?
  - Start early, and if I encounter a problem, ask for help early.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac Marshmallow.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java Marshmallow
```

You will be prompted for integer values representing distance to the fire,
fire intensity, marshmallow burn resistance, and marshmallow sugar density.
